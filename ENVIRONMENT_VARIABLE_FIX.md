# Environment Variable Fix - Netlify Deployment

## 🔧 **Issue Identified**
The environment variables were correctly set in Netlify dashboard, but the application was still showing "Configuration Required" because:
- HTML files in Netlify are served **statically** from `dist/` directory
- Environment variable injection was happening at **runtime** in `serve_ui.py`
- Static files cannot access runtime environment variables

## ✅ **Fix Applied**
Updated `build.py` to inject environment variables during the **build process**:

```python
# Environment variables are now injected at BUILD TIME
def copy_html_files(dist_dir):
    # Get environment variables during build
    supabase_url = os.getenv('SUPABASE_URL', '{{SUPABASE_URL}}')
    supabase_key = os.getenv('SUPABASE_KEY', '{{SUPABASE_KEY}}')
    
    # Replace template placeholders in HTML files
    html_content = html_content.replace('{{SUPABASE_URL}}', supabase_url)
    html_content = html_content.replace('{{SUPABASE_KEY}}', supabase_key)
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Deploy**

### ✅ **Success Indicators:**
1. **Configuration API**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/config`
   - Should return: `{"supabaseConfigured": true}`
   - Previously returned: `{"supabaseConfigured": false}`

2. **Main Application**: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
   - Should show: **Employee Dashboard** with real data
   - No more: "Configuration Required" message
   - No more: Demo mode with fake data

3. **Build Logs** (in Netlify dashboard):
   ```
   ✅ Copied index.html
   🔑 Environment variables injected into index.html
   ✅ Copied login.html
   🔑 Environment variables injected into login.html
   ✅ Copied signup.html
   🔑 Environment variables injected into signup.html
   ```

### 🚨 **If Still Not Working:**
If you still see the configuration message, check:

1. **Environment Variables** (Already ✅ Done):
   - SUPABASE_URL: `https://clcufcjifbvpbtsczkmx.supabase.co`
   - SUPABASE_KEY: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

2. **Build Logs**: Look for environment variable injection messages
3. **Fresh Deploy**: Trigger a new deploy if needed

## 🔄 **How It Now Works**

### **Build Process (Netlify Servers)**:
1. Netlify starts build with environment variables available
2. `build.py` runs and reads `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`
3. Template placeholders `{{SUPABASE_URL}}` and `{{SUPABASE_KEY}}` are replaced
4. Processed HTML files are saved to `dist/` directory
5. Static HTML files now have real credentials embedded

### **Runtime (User's Browser)**:
1. User visits site and downloads static HTML
2. JavaScript runs with real Supabase credentials (no more templates)
3. Connection to Supabase works immediately
4. Employee data loads from database

## 📊 **Technical Architecture**
```
Netlify Build Environment:
├── Environment Variables Available ✅
├── build.py runs with ENV access ✅
├── HTML templates processed ✅
└── Static files with real credentials ✅

Static Serving:
├── dist/index.html (credentials embedded) ✅
├── dist/login.html (credentials embedded) ✅
└── dist/signup.html (credentials embedded) ✅

User Browser:
├── Downloads static HTML ✅
├── JavaScript executes with real credentials ✅
└── Supabase connection works ✅
```

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**
1. Wait for Netlify deploy to complete
2. Visit your site
3. Check if you see employee dashboard (not demo mode)
4. Test `/api/config` endpoint
5. Verify data loads properly

**Deploy Status**: Changes pushed at `ae6bf48` - Environment variable injection at build time
**Expected Fix**: HTML files will have real Supabase credentials instead of template placeholders
