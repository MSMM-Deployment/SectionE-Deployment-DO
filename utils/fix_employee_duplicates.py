Employee Duplicate Cleanup Utility

This script identifies and merges duplicate employee records in the Supabase database.
It's designed to clean up the database after multiple parsing runs or data imports.

Features:
- Identifies potential duplicates using fuzzy name matching
- Merges duplicate records while preserving all data
- Updates assignments to point to the primary employee record
- Provides detailed logging of merge operations

Usage:
python fix_employee_duplicates.py

Requirements:
- Valid Supabase credentials in .env file
- Database with employee records that may contain duplicates
